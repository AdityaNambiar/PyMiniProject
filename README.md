# PyMiniProject
A quick calculator with extended 'software' related capabilities (why so much effort on a simple calculator project? Because anybody can make or get a calculator code written in Python online..)
I wanted to build something that will have some effort put into it. For me, it doesn't matter if it's ultimately a calculator, it's still something that made me learn tkinter and file operations in Python more and I am happy with it. :)

Here are few screenshots:
